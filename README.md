# Assessment: GhostPost

##Introduction:
The GhostPost Machineâ„¢ is a website where people can anonymously post Boasts or Roasts of whatever they want. Like Twitter, there is a character limit: 280 characters. We are deliberately not dealing with logins, as that is outside the scope of the project (and beyond our time constraints). 

### Front end:
A front end is necessary to make this work, though it doesn't have to be pretty -- invest as much time as you want into it.

### Back end:

Model(s) for boasts and roasts with appropriate attributes as derived from other requirements
Front end: 

Homepage that displays boasts and roasts, sorted by time submitted
buttons to filter the content by either boasts or roasts, sorted by time submitted
upvote and downvote buttons for each boast and roast
ability to sort content based on number of votes
page to submit a boast or a roast
